# IoT-Web-Based-Attack-Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based framework for detecting web-based attacks in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, as described in our paper, "Deep Learning Approaches for Detecting Web-Based Attacks in IoT Environments Using Packet-Based Features." The project utilizes the CICIoT2023 dataset to evaluate machine learning and deep learning models, including Random Forest, LightGBM, MLP, DNN, Dense DNN, SNN, DeepFM, and Tab Transformer, to classify malicious and benign IoT network traffic. Web-based attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Backdoor Malware, were simulated using the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), BeEF, and Remot3d on a Raspberry Pi to mimic vulnerable IoT web interfaces.
